# FileUpdatesAlgorithm
Description
This project defines a Python function named update_file that takes in two parameters: import_file (the file to be updated) and remove_list (a list of elements to be removed from the file). The function reads the initial contents of the file, removes the elements specified in the remove_list, and rewrites the file with the updated contents.

Function Details
Parameters:
import_file (str): The path to the file that needs to be updated.
remove_list (list): A list of elements to be removed from the file.
Functionality:
Read the initial contents of the file specified by import_file.
Split the content into a list based on spaces, treating it as a list of elements.
Iterate through the list and remove elements that match any in the remove_list.
Convert the list back to a string with elements separated by spaces.
Rewrite the original file with the updated content.
Usage Example
'''
# Import the function and call it, passing the file path and list of elements to be removed.
update_file("allow_list.txt", ["192.168.25.60", "192.168.140.81", "192.168.203.198"])

# The specified IP addresses will be removed from the file "allow_list.txt".
'''
Prerequisites
This script assumes that the provided file exists and is accessible for reading and writing.
Make sure that the file contains elements separated by spaces for proper functionality.
