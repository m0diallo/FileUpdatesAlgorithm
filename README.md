# File Updates Algorithm

## Description
This project defines a Python function named `update_file` that takes in two parameters: `import_file` (the file to be updated) and `remove_list` (a list of elements to be removed from the file). The function reads the initial contents of the file, removes the elements specified in the `remove_list`, and rewrites the file with the updated contents.

## Function Details
- **Parameters**:
  - `import_file` (str): The path to the file that needs to be updated.
  - `remove_list` (list): A list of elements to be removed from the file.

- **Functionality**:
  1. Read the initial contents of the file specified by `import_file`.
  2. Split the content into a list based on spaces, treating it as a list of elements.
  3. Iterate through the list and remove elements that match any in the `remove_list`.
  4. Convert the list back to a string with elements separated by spaces.
  5. Rewrite the original file with the updated content.

## Usage Example
```python
# Import the function and call it, passing the file path and list of elements to be removed.
update_file("allow_list.txt", ["192.168.25.60", "192.168.140.81", "192.168.203.198"])

# The specified IP addresses will be removed from the file "allow_list.txt."
